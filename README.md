# CSH_image_labeling

## ideas
1. The project is develpled by Python;
2. The project is based on Flask framework. Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja2 and good intentions.
3. The project is developed based on the idea of modularization. One module is Api which enables all logical functions. Another module is Web which helps to create front-end pages. Based on the idea of decoupling, it's easy for front-end people and back-end people to develop separately and efficiently.
